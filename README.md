# Intro to CS Projects

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of my first-year software engineering projects. Each project demonstrates fundamental programming concepts and problem-solving techniques developed throughout my coursework.

## Projects

### 1. **Basic Python Exercises**
- **Description:** A series of Python scripts focusing on basic programming constructs such as variables, loops, conditionals, and functions.

### 2. **Assignment 2**
- **Description:** This assignment covers intermediate programming concepts, including data structures, algorithmic thinking, and problem decomposition.

### 3. **Assignment 3**
- **Description:** A project focusing on more complex problem-solving, introducing topics like recursion, object-oriented programming (OOP), and advanced data manipulation.

### 4. **Assignment 4**
- **Description:** An exploration of software design principles, emphasizing modular programming, code reuse, and basic software testing methodologies.

### 5. **Assignment 5**
- **Description:** A capstone project for the first year, integrating various programming techniques learned throughout the year, with a focus on efficiency, scalability, and real-world problem-solving.

### 6. **Assignment 6**
- **Files such as:** `Customer.py`, `Group.py`, `Hostess.py`, `Manager.py`, `Person.py`, `PyBarException.py`, `Shift.py`, `Table.py`, `Waiter.py`, `Worker.py`
- **Description:** A comprehensive project that simulates a bar management system. This assignment involves multiple classes to represent customers, staff, shifts, and tables, focusing on object-oriented design, exception handling, and system simulation.

### 7. **Assignment 7**
- **Description:** An advanced project designed to showcase problem-solving skills and algorithmic thinking, emphasizing clean code practices, efficient algorithms, and real-world application scenarios.

### 8a. **Assignment 8a**
- **Files such as:** `DNA.py`, `DoublyLinkedList.py`, `Errors.py`, `FastaFileReader.py`, `LinkedList.py`, `Nucleotides.py`, `RNA.py`
- **Description:** A bioinformatics-focused project dealing with DNA and RNA sequence processing. This assignment emphasizes data structures like linked lists, file handling with FASTA formats, and error management in biological data analysis.

### 8b. **Assignment 8b**
- **Description:** A set of problem-solving scripts designed to tackle various algorithmic challenges, focusing on data manipulation, algorithm design, and optimization techniques.
